# Welcome!

**Ayyyyyy.**

Welcome to the HackGT/Tech Square Labs Python/Flask workshop. We will be building a
Twitter-like web app using Python with the Flask web framework. Along the way, we will be
using HTML, CSS, a lil drop of Javascript and some dark, dark magic to grease the wheels of
technology and apease the programming gods.

# I don't like snakes. Why are you drinking on a weekday? What are this?

Don't worry. It's not that crazy. [Flask] (http://flask.pocoo.org) is a simple and
straightforward web framework for Python that is also extremely powerful. We will start by
building a simple website that keeps track of a todo list and then move on to building the
Twitter clone.
