# Welcome!

**Ayyyyyy.**

Welcome to the HackGT/Tech Square Labs Python/Flask workshop. We will be building a
Twitter-like web app using Python with the Flask web framework. Along the way, we will be
using HTML, CSS, a lil drop of Javascript and some dark, dark magic to grease the wheels of
technology and apease the programming gods.
